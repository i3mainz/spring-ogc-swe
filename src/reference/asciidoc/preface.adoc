=== Compatible Java Versions

For _Spring Integration_ *4.2.x*, the *minimum* compatible Java version is *Java SE 6*.
Older versions of Java are not supported.

_Spring Integration_ *4.2.x* is also compatible with *Java SE 7* as well as *Java SE 8*.

Certain features (such as `Optional<?>` payloads and `CompletableFuture` gateway method return types) require Java 8.

While the jars are compatible with Java 6, Java 8 is required to build the project.
