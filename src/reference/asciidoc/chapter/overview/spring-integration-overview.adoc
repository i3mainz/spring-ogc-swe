== Spring Integration OGC

Spring Integration provides an extension of the Spring programming model to support the well-known http://www.eaipatterns.com/[Enterprise Integration Patterns].
It enables lightweight messaging _within_ Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters.
Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling.
Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.

More information on Spring Integration you can find in the http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Integration Reference].
